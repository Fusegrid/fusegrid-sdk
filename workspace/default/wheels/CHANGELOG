Changes
=======

[Models]

	* Make it possible to use a blank value as a property default - [Andy Bellenie]

	* Support NOT IN, IN, NOT LIKE, IS NULL, IS NOT NULL in where clause - [Per Djurner, Tony Petruzzi]

	* SQLite support - [Per Djurner]

	* Deprecated the "class" argument on association methods (belongsTo,hasMany,hasOne). Use "modelName" instead. - [Per Djurner]
	
	* Ability to skip validation when saving - [Tony Petruzzi]
	
	* Lockdown transactions between callbacks - #325 [Andy Bellenie]
	
	* Prepend included model properties with their class name in queries - #442 [Andy Bellenie]
	
	* Support for automatic validations - [James Gibson, Andy Bellenie, Tony Petruzzi]
	
		- configured by calling set(automaticValidations=true) in your environment's settings.cfm
	
		updates model initialization to automatically add validation to properties based on your database configuration. 
		The validations include:
		
		- validatesPresenceOf for fields that are nullable=false
		- validatesLengthOf for string fields (cf_sql_char & cf_sql_varchar)
		- validatesNumericalityOf for numeric fields, it integer is set correctly for the
		field type also.
		
		There is a new setting "automaticValidations" which is checked before setting
		any validations. Also, no automatic validations are applied to primary key fields
		or to fields for which a custom validation has already been set.
		
		automatic validations can also be turned off on a per model basis by using the
		automaticValidations(false) in the model's init() method.
		
	* Updated findAll() to allow for more than one association as long as they are direct. - [James Gibson]
	
		This means that you can do an include like include="objects,someotherobject" but not
		include="object(someotherobject)"
		
	* Update to wheels to add GROUP BY functionality - [James Gibson]
	
	* Added accessibleproperties() and protectedproperties() to protect model variables from masss assignment - [James Gibson]
	
	* Update to $create() to timestamp the updatedAt column if it exists - [James Gibson]

	* Allow views to be used as models - #390 [Tony Petruzzi]
	
		to do this, you must use setPrimaryKey() in your model's init method to tell
		Wheels what column(s) in the view it should use for the primary key(s)
		
		<cfset setPrimaryKey("column1,column2")>
		
	* Allow for nested attributes - [James Gibson]
	
	* Add automatic deletion of dependent models - #367 (Per Dejuner, Andy Bellenie]

	* Adds transaction handling support - #325 [Andy Bellenie]
	
	* Allow overriding of soft-deletes - #324 [Andy Bellenie]

	* Ability to set defaults on a model - #244 [Andy Bellenie]
	
	* Argument for model methods to be able to turn off callbacks - #236 [Andy Bellenie]
	
	* Ability to set a default value for column statistics with ifNull argument - #330 [Andy Bellenie]
	

[Dispatch]

	* Removed differences in params structure for form / URL variables - #232 [Mike Henke, Tony Petruzzi]
	
	* Added wildcard routes [Andy Bellenie]

[Controllers]

	* Update to verifies - [Tony Petruzzi]
	
		you can now do simple validations on variables
		
		you can now perform a redirect instead of aborting the entire request.
		any extra arguments passed into verifies are passed to redirectTo.

	* Added dataFunction argument to includePartial - [Per Djurner]

	* Added flashKeep() function - [Per Djurner]

	* Added layout() for specifying a controller specific layout - [Tony Petruzzi]

	* Made the showDebugInformation argument on renderPage() part of the API - [Per Djurner]
	
	* Added directory and deleteFile arguments to sendFile() - #323 [Tony Petruzzi]
	
	* Support for onMissingMethod() method - [James Gibson]
	
	* Ability to pass in arguments to filters. - [Per Djurner]
	
		Can be passed in both as named arguments and to the "args" argument.
		Example: filters(through="runIt", args=loc.someStruct, anyNameGoesHere="something")
		
	* Change to redirectTo() to allow delay of the redirection - [James Gibson, Tony Petruzzi]
	
		Use by setting the new "delay" argument to "true". By default it is set to "false" to preserve backwards compatibility
		Make sure to put a <cfreturn> on the next line after calling redirectTo() with a delay
		
		Example: <cfset redirectTo(route="home", delay="true")><cfreturn>
		
	* Added the ability to attach files with sendEmail() - [Per Djurner]
	
	* Ability to store flash in cookies - [Per Djurner]
	
	* Ability to add flash messages when redirecting - [Per Djurner]
	
		This will redirect the user back to the previous page and put a key called "notice"
		in the flash container.
		
		<!--- add a flash notice when redirecting --->
		<cfset redirectTo(back="true", notice="You are have been redirected")>
		
		<!--- get the flash notice --->
		<cfoutput>#flash("notice")#</cfoutput>
		
		
		If for some reason you need to add a key to the flash container that conflicts with
		the arguments for redirectTo(), you can prepend "flash" to your key name and wheels
		will remove the "flash" part and set your key.
		
		<!--- add a flash notice when redirecting --->
		<cfset redirectTo(back="true", flashBack="You are have been redirected")>
		
		<!--- get the flash notice --->
		<cfoutput>#flash("back")#</cfoutput>

[Views]

	* Added a flashMessages() function - [Per Djurner]

	* Added support for inherited / nested layout templates - [Per Djurner]

	* Added support for external links for specific form helpers - [Tony Petruzzi]
	
		You can use external links by passing in a URL beginning with either "http" or "https"
		to the helpers' argument listed below:
	
		linkTo - href 
		
		#linkTo(href="http://www.cfwheels.com", text="CFWheels")#
		
		startFormTag - action
		
		#startFormTag(action="https://www.cfwheels.com")#
		
		javascriptIncludeTag - sources
		
		#javaScriptIncludeTag(sources="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js")#
		
		styleSheetLinkTag - sources
		
		#styleSheetLinkTag(sources="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.7.2/themes/start/jquery-ui.css")#
		

	* Added labels by default to form fields - [Andy Bellenie]
	
		For object helpers:
		label=true -> automatically labels the field based on property or custom label
		label="" or label=false -> returns no label.
		label="anything else" -> as before.

		The new default setting is label=true. Existing 1.1 applications that had not specified a label for a field will now find automatic ones appearing.
		To correct this, either add label=""/label=false to the helper call in the view, or add a global setting for all helpers, e.g. 
		<cfset set(functionName="textField", label=false)>
		
	* Added contentFor() - [Tony Petruzzi]
	
		- takes an optional section argument to append, by default appends content for the layout section 

	* Added includeContent() - [Per Djurner, Tony Petruzzi]

	* Added "head" argument to styleSheetLinkTag and javaScriptIncludeTag - [Per Djurner]

	    - defaults to false for design & development
	    - defaults to true for testing, maintenance & production
	    - can be set to a string by the developer and the string will be appended to all asset urls
	    - when set to true, a timestamp integer is created and used for all assets generated by wheels,
	    the format is yyyymmddHHmmss
	    
	* Defaulted day to 1 and month to 1 when submitting forms - [Tony Petruzzi]
